## Chapter 2: Thinking Like an Economist

- **circular-flow diagram**: a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms.
- **production possibilities frontier**: a graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology.
- **microeconomics**: the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in markets.
- **macroeconomics**: the study of economywide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.
- **positive statements** claims that attempt to describe the world as it is.

## Chapter 3: Interdependence and the Gains from Trade

- **absolute advantage** the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer
- **opportunity cost** whatever must be given up to obtain some item
- **comparative advantage** the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer
- **imports** goods produced abroad and sold domestically 
- **exports** goods produced domestically and sold abroad

## Chapter 4: The Market Forces of Supply and Demand

- **market** a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service
- **competitive market** a market in which there are many buyers and many sellers so each has a negligible impact on the market price
- **quantity demanded** the amount of a good that buyers are willing and able to purchase
- **law of demand** the claim that, other things being equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises
- **demand schedule** a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded
- **demand curve** a graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded
- **normal good** a good for which, other things being equal, an increase in income leads to an increase in demand 
- **inferior good** a good for which, other things being equal, an increase in income leads to a decrease in demand 
- **substitutes** two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand for the other 
- **complements** two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the demand for the other
- **quantity supplied** the amount of a good that sellers are willing and able to sell
- **law of supply** the claim that, other things being equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises
- **supply schedule** a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied
- **supply curve** a graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied
- **equilibrium** a situation in which the market price has reached the level at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded
- **equilibrium price** the price that balances the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded
- **equilibrium quantity** the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price
- **surplus** a situation in which the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded
- **shortage** a situation in which the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied
- **law of supply and demand** the claim that the price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded of that good into balance
